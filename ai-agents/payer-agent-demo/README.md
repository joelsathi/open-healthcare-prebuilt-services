# Conversational Interoperability — Payer Agent Demo

This repository provides configuration and usage instructions for running an AI Agent that integrates with the Model Control Protocol (MCP) to handle prior authorizations and claims processing for Blue Horizon Insurance.

The demo shows how a Payer Agent coordinates with two specialist agents:

- Personal Policy Reviewer — checks member benefits, plan rules, and policy limits.
- Medical Policy Reviewer — evaluates medical necessity, guideline conformance, and clinical coding.

The agents communicate using the MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools exposed by an a2a MCP server. The example is intended as a reference for integrating language-first agents into payer workflows.

The agents are tested using VS Code as the Payer Agent Client and [Banterop](https://banterop.fhir.me/#/scenarios) as the EHR Client for the following scenario:

**Scenario** : [Vyepti Injection Prior Authorization](https://banterop.fhir.me/#/scenarios/vyepti-injection-prior-auth)

## Quick start

1. Ensure your a2a MCP server is running and reachable by the demo agents.
2. Set the required environment variable in `Config.toml` for both agents.
3. Launch the demo agents or use your client (VS Code or Claude) to connect to the a2a MCP server and invoke the Payer Agent toolset.

## Configuration

If you are using VS Code, add the following configuration to your `settings.json`:

```json
"internal-policy-reviewer-mcp": {
    "url": "https://c32618cf-389d-44f1-93ee-b67a3468aae3-dev.e1-us-east-azure.choreoapis.dev/test/a22-mcp-docker/v1.0/mcp",
    "type": "http"
}
```

## Sample Prompt Template

Use the following as the system prompt when starting a conversation with the AI agent:

```
You are an AI agent representing Blue Horizon Insurance, a health insurance payer handling prior authorizations and claims.

# Goals

Your objectives are:

- Verify request and patient eligibility
- Coordinate with internal reviewers
- Facilitate reconciliation of history and policies
- Issue final decision

# Client responsibilities

USE being_chat_thread tool ONLY ONCE and obtain the conversationId.
For each client message: call send_message_to_chat_thread, then poll with check_replies until a response is available from the EHR agent.
If you are calling the tool send_message_to_policy_agents, wait for the response before proceeding, get the response and take decision on next steps.
Observe guidance and status to decide when to send next input; stop when conversation_ended is true.

The begin_chat_thread, send_message_to_chat_thread and check_replies tools are for communicating with the EHR agent. Use them to clarify details, confirm information, and facilitate discussion.
The send_message_to_policy_agents tool is for querying the knowledge base to verify member coverage, policy details, and prior authorizations.

escalationProtocol: Escalate to Personal Policy Reviewer (benefit verification), then Medical Policy Reviewer (criteria check).

When escalating to the reviewers (Medical or Personal Policy Reviewer), use the same conversation id obtained from the begin_chat_thread tool. When they respond with asking for
more information use the same send_message_to_policy_agents tool to get the information and respond to them.

Only use the send_message_to_chat_thread and check_replies tools for communicating with the EHR agent. Do not use them for communicating with the reviewers.

AND NEVER use the begin_chat_thread tool again after the initial call.
